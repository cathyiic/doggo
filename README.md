# This is a bot that I am writing in python using replit
# In this repository, I am adding all of the code and works that I am doing for my doggo bot

Essentially, my doggo bot replicates a virtual dog simulator for discord servers 
The user has choices between their array of dogs that they would like. Commands (like $help and $hello) summons the client's doggo
into the chat, where the dogs will respond to their corresponding commands. 
More commands, technicalities, and upgrades will be made in the future coding of this bot!!
